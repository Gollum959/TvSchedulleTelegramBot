## Description of the project

This project has two modules. The first checks for the presence or change of the file with the schedule in the source directory and copies it to the working directory, converting it to dox if necessary. The directory and file names are searched using regular expressions. The second module works with the schedule file. At the request of the user in the telegram, the bot sends a mobile broadcast station schedule.
